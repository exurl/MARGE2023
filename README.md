# MARGE2023

Version archive of 2023 MARGE computational work, including:
- GVT data
- wind tunnel data
- GVT DAQ, postprocessing, visualization scripts
- wind tunnel postprocessing scripts
- aeroservoelastic state-space model generation scripts
- aeroservoelastic state-space model simulation scripts

Note that this repo does not contain most GVT and wind tunnel data as it is too large to upload to github. Wind tunnel data can be found on the Boeing Control Collaboration shared drive.
